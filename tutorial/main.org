TO BE done.

The idea is to merge stuff from   
  + http://research.iac.es/sieinvens//SINFIN/Main/supercomputing.php 
  + https://research.iac.es/sieinvens/siepedia/pmwiki.php?n=HOWTOs.Condor
  + http://research.iac.es/sieinvens/SINFIN/Condor/index.php

so that we end up with a tutorial doc + example scripts, etc. that people can
download and play with.
