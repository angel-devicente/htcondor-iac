The example in the previous section HTCondor /Hello World!/ used the
variable $(Process) to identify the different jobs in a single run. Sometimes
this is enough, but not always. Say you have 100 images to process and your
executable takes the filename of the image as an argument. If you were going to
use the same method as above, you would need to rename your files to something
like image00.jpg, image01.jpg, etc. or some other similar idea, in order to
relate each image with each of the possible values of $(Process).
